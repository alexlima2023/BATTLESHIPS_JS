# üö¢ Battleship with HTML, CSS and JS ‚öì

## Description ‚ö†Ô∏è

> "In the game Battleship, you face off against the computer in a battle of naval strategy. You'll strategically position your fleet of ships on a grid, hidden from your opponent. Then, you take turns calling out coordinates to launch attacks on the computer's fleet, aiming to sink all of its ships before it sinks yours. The game requires keen deduction and tactical thinking to outsmart the computer and emerge as the victorious admiral."
